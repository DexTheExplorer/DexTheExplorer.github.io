<p>Nothing is a brand that has changed my perspective on technology as a whole.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tech that looks, feels and lives like nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their movtive is to “make tech fun again”, where they got me hopping into the boat on day one. You could say that I instantly fell in love with the brand, and I’m not ashamed to admit it.</p>
<h2 id="the-phone1">The phone(1)</h2>
<p>This phone looks just beautiful. Its glyph design and transparent glass back lifts it from the typical Android phone you see around.
Maybe the lights on the back are “niche” or “just a stupid toy”, but I see it as art. The art of trying something different. And succeeding.</p>
<p>I dropped my flagship Pixel 7 for this mid-range, and to be honest, I never used the power-user features that the Pixel brought. I just used it for social media, YouTube, and the occasional game. I don’t need a flagship, and I don’t need a phone that’s “good enough”. I need a phone that’s fun to use, and that’s what the phone(1) is.</p>
<h3 id="my-phone-describes-my-personality">My phone describes my personality</h3>
<p>I am different. I love to be different. And most importantly, I adore showing others that I am. No shame in doing my own thing, making my own adventure whilst I’m at it.</p>

<h2 id="the-ear2">The ear(2)</h2>
<p>Now, these buds made me notice that the music files I have on my phone are actually trash. I’m not kidding. I thought that my music was good, but I was wrong. I was so wrong.</p>
<p>The audio quality and latency on these buds are absolutely crazy. I can’t even describe it. I’m not an audiophile, but I can tell you that these buds are the best I’ve ever used. Maybe they aren’t as comfortable as they could be, but I don’t care. I’m not going to be wearing them for hours on end, so it doesn’t really matter to me.</p>
