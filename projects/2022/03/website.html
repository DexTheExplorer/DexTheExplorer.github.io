            <h1 id="my-first-hand-made-website-is-live">My first hand-made website is live!</h1>
            <p>This isn&#39;t my first entry into web-development but will definetly be the most memorable. I&#39;ve gotten myself together and started to work on a major project outside of game engines or basic style changing using browser dev-tools.</p>
            <h2 id="whats-the-motivation">What&#39;s the motivation?</h2>
            <p>My computer class is on its way to learn Python and so am I. Python is great for all-purpose development which is why I strive to create something beforehand and make it better afterwards.</p>
            <h2 id="python">Python!</h2>
            <p>Yeah, Python. I&#39;ve heard some stuff online that Python is slow or difficult to master. This doesn&#39;t bother me very much. What does bother me is that we&#39;re developing on Windows 7 EoL computers in the lab. It doesn&#39;t have Visual Studio Code or even Notepad++. Instead we are using an online tool which I won&#39;t mention here. Yuck!</p>
            <h2 id="future-website-changes">Future website changes</h2>
            <p><em>&quot;Why do you mumble so much about Python and Windows 7?!&quot;</em> - Well, the website is currently built only from static HTML and CSS. A few decades ago this was normal but I plan to add a bunch of dynamic content to the website later on.</p>
            <p>Such as: <del>advertisements</del> - I would never. Instead I was thinking of adding my own personal gallery where I can show off my favorite creations because, as you may know, I love creating wallpapers and mathematical art. They&#39;ll be completely free to download, trust me!</p>
